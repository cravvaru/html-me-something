		<h2>Italy: Ciao Bella!</h2>

		    My touristy spot: Italia. Italy is the stereotypical vacation destination. So of course I had to include it on my list! From the Gondola rides to amazing cuisine, there is so much to explore in this country. What I would be most excited to see are the longstanding buildings that have been able to endure time. Besides the Colloseum, many of the churches and pinnacle structures have architecture with beauty that can only be found here. Prime pick: the Vatican. If time permits, I would love to take a trip to the countryside to explore some of the wineries that hold so much history. Vida y vino right?

		<h2>Ireland </h2>

		    My unusual spot: Ireland. We can thank this choice to Game of Thrones and P.S. I Love you. I never had the desire to go to Ireland until I watched these two, but after seeing them, I realized how much undiscovered beauty Ireland holds. There is vast countryside to explore, and I think if I went here, I’d most like to stay in a small cottage or Bed & Breakfast to get a true experience of it. On the other hand, what girl wouldn’t enjoy spending a night in a castle fit for Cinderella.

		<h2>Australia: Hop with me, mate </h2>

		    My dream spot: Australia. For as long as I can remember, Australia has always been the one place in the world I have wanted to visit. Maybe it’s the sunny attitudes everyone seems to have. Or maybe it’s the memories I have watching the Australian Open every year with my dad. Either way, it’s a place I would like to visit before I settle down. I would love to see a show at the Sydney Opera House, take a trek through the Outback, or swim near the Great Barrier Reef. First on the agenda though would be having a quick chat with the stingray that took our beloved Steve Irwin. Then I’ll be on my way to find Nemo.
